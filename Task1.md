## Understanding Key Terminologies and Differences between AI, ML, DL, and GenAI

---

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Unlike traditional programming where we have a defined set of rules and conditions, in Artificial Intelligence what we do is make **predictions**.  
For this, we need some sort of input, right? So **data serves as input** in AI to make predictions based on the given data.  
We make use of several techniques like **Machine Learning (subfield of AI)** and **Deep Learning (subset of ML)**.  

👉 The predictions depend heavily on the input data. The **better the data quality**, the higher the chances of making accurate predictions.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is the **subset of AI**. As the name suggests, our machine (computer) **learns from the data** we give it as input and makes predictions using several algorithms like **regression, classification, etc.**  

We can classify it into some main types:
- **Supervised Learning**  
- **Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning is the **subset of Machine Learning**.  
In DL, we use **neural networks** (computer models inspired by the brain that process data through layers of connected “neurons”) with **many layers** to handle very complex problems.  

Some common applications include:
- **Computer Vision**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Speech Recognition**

## Generative AI (GenAI)

Generative AI is the **subset of Deep Learning**. As the name suggests, it focuses on **generating or creating new content** rather than just making predictions.  
This content could be in the form of **text, images, audio, videos, or even code**.  

GenAI makes use of **large models trained on huge amounts of data** (for example, Large Language Models in the case of text) to learn patterns and then produce outputs that look human-like.  

**Common examples include:**
- **ChatGPT** → text generation  
- **DALL·E** → image generation  
- **GitHub Copilot** → code suggestions  

👉 The main idea here is not only to understand data but also to **create something new** from it.
